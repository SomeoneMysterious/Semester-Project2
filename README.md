# Semester-Project2
My second semester project.  
Last semester's project can be found
[here.](https://github.com/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project "My first semester project")
  
Plans for this semester project:  
I plan to make a wave-based attack game where the window shrinks when you lose health.  
I hope to have actual images used, rather then drawing everything  
I also hope to object-orient these/this program.  
I may add music, some minor voice commands, or some internet usage.

Changelog for Alpha 2.0:\
Added top menubar full of commands\
Added sounds (If you install pygame)\
Handles if you don't have pygame installed\
The game can be paused/unpaused through either 'p' key or the menubar\
Background color can be changed in menubar\
Volume can be changed if pygame is installed in the menubar\
Legs of enemies motions can be toggled\
Fixed enemies possibly going past the tower when not getting updated\
Made all pictures have a transparent background\
Note about menubar:\
The enemies keep on moving if you don't select anything, and will update when the menubar hides.\
However, if you select something from the menubar, the enemies will not move.\
You can find previous changes
