# Semester-Project2
My second semester project.  
Last semester's project can be found
[here.](https://github.com/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project "My first semester project")
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project2)](https://repl.it/github/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project2) \
Built in Python 3.7, won't work in 2.X, Minimum possible (as far as I know) is 3.4 till the end of 3.X

Plans for this semester project:  
I plan to make a wave-based attack game where the window shrinks when you lose health.  
I hope to have actual images used, rather then drawing everything  
I also hope to object-orient these/this program.  
I may add music, some minor voice commands, or some internet usage.

Changelog for Alpha 3.1:\
Fixed a compatibility issue\
Added proper handling of closing the setup window size window\
Should now properly run on repl.it\
Did a very simple python formatting thing (name = main)\
Removed unnecessary screen shrink file\
