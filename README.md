# Semester-Project2
My second semester project.  
Last semester's project can be found
[here.](https://github.com/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project "My first semester project")
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project2)](https://repl.it/github/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project2) \
Built in Python 3.7/3.8, won't work in 2.X, Minimum possible (as far as I know) is 3.4 till the end of 3.X

Plans for this semester project:  
I plan to make a wave-based attack game where the window shrinks when you lose health.  
I hope to have actual images used, rather then drawing everything  
I also hope to object-orient these/this program.  
I may add music, some minor voice commands, or some internet usage.

Changelog for Alpha 4.0:\
Added information window (and it's own class)\
Added a toggle in the menubar to toggle the info window\
Added a toggle in the menubar to allow auto-pause between rounds (defualt is not)\
Added a option in the menubar to restart the game - runs everywhere except when resizing window\
Made text that pops up for each round\
Made a visible scorecounter that way you can see the score\
Added a ammo limit and the ability to reload\
Made it that when the window gets really small, rather than the View window disappearing, the Shop menu becomes S.\
Made it that way resize window will be done anytime not mid round\
Added back in varied enemy speeds (forgot about that)\
Fixed an issue while reading the config that ignored a few options\
Fixed a compatibility issue that apparently I forgot about (smooth)\
Changed how the rainbow was coded, hopefully is good for competitive\
List handleing programmed better (list comprehension)\
Commented my code because that's important\
