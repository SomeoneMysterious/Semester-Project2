# Semester-Project2
My second semester project.  
Last semester's project can be found
[here.](https://github.com/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project "My first semester project")
  
Plans for this semester project:  
I plan to make a wave-based attack game where the window shrinks when you lose health.  
I hope to have actual images used, rather then drawing everything  
I also hope to object-orient these/this program.  
I may add music, some minor voice commands, or some internet usage.
