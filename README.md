# Semester-Project2
My second semester project.  
Last semester's project can be found
[here.](https://github.com/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project "My first semester project")
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project2)](https://repl.it/github/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project2) \
Built in Python 3.7/3.8, won't work in 2.X, Minimum possible (as far as I know) is 3.4 till the end of 3.X

Plans for this semester project:  
I plan to make a wave-based attack game where the window shrinks when you lose health.  
I hope to have actual images used, rather then drawing everything  
I also hope to object-orient these/this program.  
I may add music, some minor voice commands, or some internet usage.

Changelog for Alpha 5.0:\
Added the new enemy that shoots at the tower\
Added bullets (and their own class)\
Added text that displays at the bottom of the information window to tell you things\
Added in the game a difficulty selector, but difficulties are not impliemented yet\
You can now set a seed for the game to use to replicate the randomness\
Seperated each class into it's own file (except tower because it's almost empty)\
Made the Shop menu able to pop out\
Made it that way when you setup a new window size, you cannot make it too small in either direction\
Added Window full sized for 20 secs for 20 Points in the shop\
You can find previous changes
