# Semester-Project2
My second semester project.  
Last semester's project can be found
[here.](https://github.com/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project "My first semester project")
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project2)](https://repl.it/github/SomeoneMysterious/Semester-Project2)
  
Plans for this semester project:  
I plan to make a wave-based attack game where the window shrinks when you lose health.  
I hope to have actual images used, rather then drawing everything  
I also hope to object-orient these/this program.  
I may add music, some minor voice commands, or some internet usage.

Changelog for Alpha 3.0:\
Added config file to store info for the device\
Config file handles window making properly\
Config can now read and save volume, background, and leg animation toggle\
Background color can be set to rainbow\
Added a resize window on the menubar-see note below\
Finally made all enemies have the same base speed, wherever spawned (turns out the ceil of a fraction doesn't help)\
Fixed the fact that enemies on the top and bottom would screw up speed as the window shrank (using the wrong variable sucks)\
Fixed (previously unnoticed) enemy spawning oversight\
Now can change music and effects volumes separately\
Made winSize class and moved window info to there\
Notes about resize window on menubar:\
You must kill the current wave of enemies before it will let you resize\
The resize window will likely show up behind the game window, so you will need to move the game window out of the way\
You can find previous changes
